Steps
---

Build ldms package for the nodes (Producers)

```console
#
# Change to build dir
#
cd build

#
# Start the Ubuntu build container
#
./start_build_container.ubuntu.bash

#
# Inside the container, build the LDMS package
#
pushd /builds/ovis/ && ../scripts/build_ldms.ubuntu.bash

#
# The build prodcut (ovis-ldms-<YOUR_VERSION>.deb) will be in the root of the ovis source dir.
#
# On each producer node, install the package and start the LDMS sampler service:
#
dpkg -i ovis-ldms-<YOUR_VERSION>.deb
systemctl enable nersc-ldmsd.sampler.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start nersc-ldmsd.sampler.service
systemctl is-active nersc-ldmsd.sampler.service

#
# Verify the LDMS service is running:
#
/opt/ovis-ldms/sbin/ldms_ls -a ovis -A conf=/opt/ovis-ldms/etc/ldms/ldmsauth.conf -p 6002 -h localhost
```

Setup Aggregator image and helm chart

```console
#
# Build the OCI Image for the LDMS Aggregator, and push to registry used by k8s
#
pushd oci
./build.bash

#
# Setup Helm chart (node_map, ldms confg files, bundle in k8s ConfigMaps)
#
pushd ../chart/nersc-ldms-aggr/
cp ldms_machine_config.dell.json default_config.json
make clean
make

#
# Test Chart template
#
helm template --debug --values values.yaml nersc-ldms-aggr

#
# Install Chart
#
helm install -n telem nersc-ldms-aggr nersc-ldms-aggr --values values.yaml

#
# Verify
#
./health_check.bash

#
# Setup kafka, as ldms will publish to the kafka topic
#
setup_strimzi_kafka.bash

#
# Watch kafka for data
#
kubectl -n telem exec -it cluster-controller-0 -- bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server cluster-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic nersc-ldms
```
